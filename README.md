# Web Scraping with R

## General information

**Abstract**

> If programming is magic, then *web scraping* is wizardry (Mitchell 2015: vii)

This short workshop introduces students to the technique of webscraping with R. 
Participants will learn a general scheme that can be applied to scrape information 
from the web. First, the workshop provides a brief introduction to the 
underlying structure of the modern web. Second, after acquiring this knowledge, we 
will go through the individual steps that are necessary to retrieve information from 
a website. Finally, we will discuss legal requirements and ethics of webscraping. 
Throughout the workshop, several hands-on examples will be used. In this way, the 
participants are equipped with the necessary knowledge to set up their own webscraping
projects.

**Requirements**

The course will use R to illustrate the prospects and challenges of retrieving 
information from the web. Accordingly, basic knowledge of [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) are helpful but
not required. In order to get the most out of the course, however, participants
should acquire basic knowledge of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). 
This can be achieved by reading the chapter 1 and 4-6 from the freely available 
([R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)). If you are more the interactive 
type of learner, I recommend the (free) courses by [RStudio](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers). 
In particular, the three modules in "[Working with Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2)" 
are great resources. If that is still not enough, there is also a [YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/). 

Finally, please bring a laptop with the latest version of R and RStudio installed. 
Also install the following packages:
